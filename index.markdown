  <h2 class="mobile-only"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>

I am a PhD candidate examining how the epistemic value of replicability in machine learning can be aligned with feminist values. Using philosophical and qualitative methods, I study how replicability can reform ML knowledge & technology production toward more responsible futures and reduce AI hype.
