  <h2 class="mobile-only"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong>:</h2>

    
**I develop evidence-based communication of the social impact of Machine Learning research and technology to counter hype and harmful applications.** Drawing on philosophical and qualitative methods, I (1) develop normative arguments for enforcing communication accountability in research and technology, (2) diagnose how existing communication practices enable harms in concrete contextsâ€”such as AI hype in policingâ€”by analyzing stakeholder discourse, and (3) propose methodological and institutional reforms to create conditions for more responsible communication norms in research and technology production.

ðŸŒŸ I am on the job market seeking postdoc positions centering (1) philosophical and empirical analyses of responsible communication in Machine Learning, and (2) the policy and regulatory possibilities that follow. If you know a good fit, please reach out to me at, tfk@psu.edu. Details about my previous and ongoing projects - [HERE](https://koutianqi.github.io/pages/research/).

## **BIO**:
<div markdown="1">
I am a PhD Candidate at Penn State Information School advised by [Dr. Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net). My doctoral training is in Philosophy of Science and Sciecne and Technology Studies. I am an affiliate of [Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence (CSRAI)](https://csrai.psu.edu) at Penn State, and a Liberal Tech Scholar at critical tech pubilcation [LOGIC(S)](https://logicmag.io), and a visiting scholar at [Critical Technocultures Lab](https://www.crit-technocultures.com) at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech. Before Penn State, I received a BS from Harbin Institute of Technology and Monash University with high honors, and a MS from Fordham University with Dean's Fellowship where I developed a semi-supervised variant of Support Vector Machines. Afterwards, I worked in industry for two years as a Machine Learning Engineer. These experiences shifted my earlier views of science, revealing it to be subjective, messy, and political, and motivating me to examine the epistemic and ethical implications of such nature.

## **UPDATES**:
<div class="updates" markdown="1">

- I presented Work-in-Progress (W/ [Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net), [Nasser Eledroos](https://nasser.wiki), [David Gray Widder](https://davidwidder.me), [Dasha Pruss](https://www.dashapruss.com)) titled "A Relational Conception of AI Hype in AI-Based Tools in Policing Context" that was accepted to the [Hype Studies Conference](https://hypestudies.org/conference) in Barcelona, Spain, slides avaible upon chat.
- (2025 Jul) Lead author paper (w/ [Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net) and [Cindy Lin](https://lincindy.com)) has been accepted to 2025 proceedings of ACM/AAAI AI Ethics and Society which will be held in Madrid, Spain from Oct 20th to 22nd. This paper delineats the epistemic conditions of ML that resist meaningful accountability for the communicative dimension of ML research. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08739) or [TL;DR](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/koutianqi_dead-zone-of-accountability-why-social-claims-activity-7361214088003108864-3aJR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACPLLPcBeEM19ytgUOpXQQb6x_SjOdrvjtQ).
