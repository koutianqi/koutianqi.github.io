**Welcome!** I am a PhD Candidate at Penn State Information School advised by [Dr. Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net). I study how implicit and explicit communication norms—or their absence—shape the validity of ML research argumentation and broader discourse about AI tools’ capabilities. Drawing on philosophical and qualitative methods, my ultimate aim is to improve ML **research rigor** and **social accountability** of ML research & technologies by:

(1) **dissecting** how harms (e.g. AI hype) emerge from communication; (2) **developing** responsible communication norms to mitigate these harms; (3) **enforcing** such norms through academic, policy, or legal reforms.

🌟 <ins>I am on the job market seeking postdoc positions</ins> centering (1) philosophical and empirical analyses of responsible communication in Machine Learning, and (2) the policy and regulatory possibilities that follow. If you know a good fit, please reach out to me at, tfk@psu.edu. Details about my previous and ongoing projects - [HERE](https://koutianqi.github.io/pages/research/).

## **BIO**:
<div class="pubs" markdown="1">
I am a PhD Candidate at Penn State Information School advised by [Dr. Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net), an affiliate of [Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence (CSRAI)](https://csrai.psu.edu) at Penn State, and a Liberal Tech Scholar at critical tech pubilcation [LOGIC(S)](https://logicmag.io). I am also a visiting scholar at [Critical Technocultures Lab](https://www.crit-technocultures.com) at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.

I received a BS in Economics from Harbin Institute of Technology and Monash University with high honors, and a MS in Computer Science from Fordham University with Dean's Fellowship where I developed a semi-supervised variant of Support Vector Machines. Afterwards, I worked in industry for two years as a Machine Learning Engineer. These experiences shifted my earlier views of science, revealing it to be subjective, messy, and political, and motivating me to examine the epistemic and ethical implications of such nature.

## **UPDATES**:
<div class="updates pubs" markdown="1">

- I presented Work-in-Progress (w/Dana Calacci, Nasser Eledroos, David Gray Widder, Dasha Pruss) titled "A Relational Conception of AI Hype in AI-Based Tools in Policing Context" at [Hype Studies Conference](https://hypestudies.org/conference) in Barcelona, Spain, slides avaible upon chat.
- (2025 Oct) I will present our paper (w/ [Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net) and [Cindy Lin](https://lincindy.com)) "Dead Zone of Accountability" at the 8th ACM/AAAI Conference Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Society in Madrid, Spain from 20th to 22nd.
- (2025 Sep) I will present our work in progress (w/ [Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net), [Nasser Eledroos](https://nasser.wiki), [David Gray Widder](https://davidwidder.me), [Dasha Pruss](https://www.dashapruss.com)) at the inaugural [Hype Studies Conference](https://hypestudies.org) in Barcelona, Spain held at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. The conference has a mixed attendees such as researchers, designers, filmmakers, come say hi! I will present on the opening day of the 10th.
- (2025 Jul) Lead author paper (w/ [Dana Calacci](https://www.dcalacci.net) and [Cindy Lin](https://lincindy.com)) has been accepted to the 2025 ACM/AAAI AI Ethics and Society. This paper delineats the epistemic conditions of ML that resist meaningful accountability for the communicative dimension of ML research. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08739) or [TL;DR](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/koutianqi_dead-zone-of-accountability-why-social-claims-activity-7361214088003108864-3aJR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACPLLPcBeEM19ytgUOpXQQb6x_SjOdrvjtQ).
- (2025 May) I will attend the Privacy Law Scholar Conference at UCLA this year! Fascinating discussions with [Rohan Grover](https://www.rohangrover.org) on his WIP on politics of expertise, and [Amina Abdu](https://aminaxabdu.github.io) and [Abigail Jacob's](https://azjacobs.com) (now forthcoming) law review article on standard as metaphor!
- (2025 May) Honored to be one of the finalists of 2025 **Sloan Metascience and AI Postdoctoral Fellow**, many thanks to [Richmond Wong](https://richmondywong.com).
