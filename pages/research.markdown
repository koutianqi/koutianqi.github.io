### I. Machine Learning Research Communication 
### <span style="color: #A9A9A9;">Machine Learning scientists are inextricably connected to downstream impact but it remains a challenge to trace concrete paths of their “foundational” research to harms, a distinguishing feature from ML practitioners. How should Machine Learning scientists navigate the responsibilities of producing sound and/or usable knowledge and the responsibilities for the social impact that their research outputs undergird? To this end, I have developed normative arguments and conceptual tools for holding ML scientists accountable for social impact through research communication.</span>
