_Below are my past and on-going work as well as existing puzzles. Note: In computer and information science, papers published in major conference proceedings are double-anonymously peer reviewed and recognized as equivalent research contributions to journal articles._

### I. Machine Learning Research Communication 
### _<span style="color: #A9A9A9;">Machine Learning scientists are inextricably connected to downstream impact but it remains a challenge to trace concrete paths of their “foundational” research to harms, a distinguishing feature from ML practitioners. How should Machine Learning scientists navigate the responsibilities of producing sound and/or usable knowledge and the responsibilities for the social impact that their research outputs undergird? To this end, I have developed normative arguments and conceptual tools for holding ML scientists accountable for social impact through research communication.</span>_

 - This paper introduces the concepts of the claim–reality gap and the dead zone of accountability to diagnose why social claims in ML research resist scrutiny, and propose strategies to articulate and defend such claims as a way of creating accountability upstream, before harms manifest.
- **Kou, Tianqi**. "From Model Performance to Claim: How a Change of Focus in Machine Learning Replicability Can Help Bridge the Responsibility Gap." Proceedings of the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency. 2024. [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13131?).
 - This paper argues that ML scientists should be accountable not just for replicating model performance but for making replicable claims about their research. By shifting the focus from performance replicability to claim replicability, I show how accountability can be embedded into research communication, helping bridge the responsibility gap between scientists and downstream impacts.

### II. Technology Capabilities Communication
### _<span style="color: #A9A9A9;">Machine Learning in its various forms (from early rule-based algorithms to now large-scale architectures) have galvanized the development of AI tools for a wide variety of application domains. However, premature adoptions of these tools in have bred cultural harms (such as hype) and concrete harms (such as inequity and exploitation). To this end, I study how these harms arise from how different stakeholder groups communicate about certain technologies’ capabilities and how to mitigate these harms through responsible communication.</span>_ 

### III. Enforcing Responsible Communication
### _<span style="color: #A9A9A9;">A core issue to the scholarship on socially responsible computing is translating conceptual understandings & tools into practical solutions. A key strand of my future research is translating my theorization into practical tools, policies, and legal frameworks. To this end, I have several work-in-progress.</span>_
