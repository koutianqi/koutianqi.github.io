Based at Penn State Information School, my doctoral training is in Philosophy of Science and Sciecne and Technology Studies. I am an affiliate of [Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence](https://csrai.psu.edu), and a Liberal Tech Scholar at critical tech pubilcation [LOGIC(S)](https://logicmag.io), and a visiting scholar at [Critical Technocultures Lab](https://www.crit-technocultures.com) based at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.
  
  Before Penn State, I received a BS from Harbin Institute of Technology and Monash University with high honors, and a MS from Fordham University with Dean's Fellowship where I developed a semi-supervised variant of Support Vector Machines. Afterwards, I worked in industry for two years as a Machine Learning Engineer.

These experiences shifted my earlier views of science, revealing it to be subjective, messy, and political, and motivating me to examine the epistemic and ethical implications of such nature.
